# Notion: Travel Countdown Timer
To modify a code from Apption, to create an embedded widget for Notion, which is a Timer to count down the day to travel.

## Modification
The code framework is from Apption.
The changes I made:
1. Time and date the timer counts down to;
2. Color of the four parts: Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds; and
3. Distance between the four patterns.

## Original Code
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/ShoroukAziz/notion_widgets/blob/master/countDown.html).

## Modified Code
The modified code can be found [here](https://github.com/rooosaJUJU/Notion_Travel_Countdown_Timer/blob/main/countdown_timer.html).

## Application
[Here](https://deserted-animantarx-5b4.notion.site/3d69acf804b54a9e95f0094621ba0654) is where the widget is embeddedâ€”in the "Winter Holidays" page in my Notion.
