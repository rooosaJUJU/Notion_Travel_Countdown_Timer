# Notion: Travel Countdown Timer
To modify a code from Apption, to create an embedded widget for Notion, which is a Timer to count down the day to travel.

## Modification
The code framework is from Apption.
The changes I made:
+ Time and date the timer counts down to;
+ Color of the four parts: Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds; and
+ Distance between the four patterns.

## Original Code
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/ShoroukAziz/notion_widgets/blob/master/countDown.html).
