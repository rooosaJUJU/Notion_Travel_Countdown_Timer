# Notion: Travel Countdown Timer
To modify a code from Apption, to create an embedded widget for Notion, which is a Timer to count down the day to travel.

## Modification
The code framework is from Apption.
The changes I made:
1. Time and date the timer counts down to;
2. Color of the four parts: Days, Hours, Minutes, and Seconds; and
3. Distance between the four patterns.
